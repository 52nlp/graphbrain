# GraphBrain Help

GraphBrain is a system that allows you to easily create, populate and explore knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are a way to record information in networks of relationships, in a very similar fashion to how we keep memories in our own brains.

Knowledge graphs can be collaborative: you can allow other users to collaborate in adding knowledge to your graphs.

In this document we will explain how to:

* Create a new knowledge graph
* Add knowledge to the graph in several ways
* Explore and navigate
* Switch to other graphs
* Add collaborators to your graphs
