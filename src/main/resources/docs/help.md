# GraphBrain Help

GraphBrain is a system that allows you to easily create, populate and explore knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are a way to record information in networks of relationships, in a very similar fashion to how we keep memories in our own brains.

Knowledge graphs can be collaborative: you can allow other users to collaborate in adding knowledge to your graphs.

In this document we will explain how to:

* Create a new knowledge graph
* Add knowledge to the graph in several ways
* Explore and navigate
* Switch to other graphs
* Add collaborators to your graphs

### The current graph

The top bar always includes an indicator of the current knowledge graph. It's right next to the input area. Every GraphBrain user has a personal graph, and this is the one you start with by default.

By clicking the graph indicator you can access a drop-down menu with commands related to the creation, management and navigation of graphs.


### Create new knowledge graph

Click the graph indicator to access the drop-down menu and choose "Create". You are displayed with a dialog asking for the name and description of the graph. Upon creation, you are sent to the new graph's home node.


### Add knowledge to a graph

Knowledge is added through the top bar input area. This is the are labelled with "Search or tell me something". Currently, there are two fundamental ways to add knowledge:

* By writing a simple sentence
* By pasting the URL of a web page

#### Writing simple sentences to add facts

#### Pasting URLs to bookmark and extract topics

### Explore and navigate
